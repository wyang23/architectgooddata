2,UQ:732330,The urban transport crisis in emerging economies: an introduction,Book Chapter,"This chapter discusses urban transport issues, policies, and initiatives in [The Urban Transport Crisis in Emerging Economies: An Introduction/Australia]. Consistent with the other case studies, it covers the following set of issues: Urban land-use patterns and spatial structure; Trends in transport use and mobility; Urban transport problems; Urban transport governance, decision-making, and financing; Proposed urban transport solutions and implementation issues; and Other country-specific issues. The object of this framework is to allow for a comparative analysis across the case studies. This book discusses urban transport issues, policies, and initiatives in 12 of the worlds major emerging economiesBrazil, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, and Vietnamcountries with large populations that have recently experienced large changes in urban structure, motorization, and all the associated social, economic, and environmental impacts in positive and negative senses. It documents the worsening transport crisis and differences among these countries in their urban transport and land-use systems. It includes chapters on each of these 12 countries, focusing on one or more major cities per country. In order to present the case studies in a more comparable way, all chapters follow a common format. Each chapter covers the following set of issues: Urban land-use patterns and spatial structure; Trends in transport use and mobility; Urban transport problems; Urban transport governance, decision-making, and financing; Proposed urban transport solutions and implementation issues; and Other country-specific issues. The object of this framework is to help to identify new explanatory factors that may be overlooked in research limited to single cities or nations. By including cities and countries across all continents, the aim is to identify useful lessons on how to achieve urban sustainability goals across the globe.",2018-09-27T07:40:17Z,Book Chapter,"Pojani, Dorina| Stead, Dominic|",10.1007/978-3-319-43851-1_1,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,,"Introduction, foreword, editorial or appendix","Cham, Switzerland",Springer,Mobility policy| Public transport| Public transport service| South african city| Urban transport|,"3322 Urban Studies| 3305 Geography, Planning and Development|"
3,UQ:685398,Barriers to the pedestrianization of city centres: perspectives from the Global North and the Global South,Journal Article,"Drawing on personal interviews with local planners, this paper examines barriers to the pedestrianization of city centres in two contrasting settings, one in a Global North city (Brisbane, Australia) and the other in a Global South city (Kathmandu, Nepal). These cases are illuminating because Brisbane already contains a popular three-block pedestrian mall in its CBD (Central Business District), but proposals to expand it have not met with support, whereas Kathmandus plans to pedestrianize its busy historic centre have failed so far. While the cultural and economic circumstances of Brisbane and Kathmandu vary significantly, there are similarities as well as differences in their barriers to pedestrianization. The barriers include: (1) opposition from residents and motorists; (2) opposition from local merchants; (3) cost recovery; (4) access of delivery vehicles; (5) management of alternative transport and parking; (6) enforcement; and (7) institutional and political support. These types of barriers are certainly not unique to these two cities. It is very probable that similar issues are encountered in other Global North and Global South cities. It is clear that political, institutional and social barriers are more significant than technical and financial barriers. A dominating car culture is responsible for the general lack of commitment to pedestrianization.",2017-09-18T02:24:38Z,Journal Article,"Parajuli, Ayush| Pojani, Dorina|",10.1080/13574809.2017.1369875,2017-09-15T00:00:00Z,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,Article (original research),"Abingdon, Oxon, United Kingdom",Routledge,"Geography, Planning and Development| Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)| Urban Studies|","3305 Geography, Planning and Development| 1201 Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)| 3322 Urban Studies|"
4,UQ:8b85d0c,"Designing the subtropical city: an evaluation of climate-sensitive policy effects in Brisbane, Australia",Journal Article,"Faced with global warming, Australia aims to wean itself from mechanical approaches to cooling homes. Cities are searching for passive solutions to residential development. These involve the use of porches, basements, natural ventilation, tree shading and the like. In 2016, the Brisbane City Council introduced the New World City Design Guide: Buildings that Breathe (BtB), a non-binding policy document to guide new development in a subtropical climate. The aim of this study was to establish the effectiveness of BtB on overall development outcomes in Brisbane. We found that development applications received after the implementation of the BtB policy incorporated more subtropical design elements than those applications received before the policy. However, overall designers and developers had responded poorly to subtropical design guidance due to various path dependencies.

5,UQ:9f607ef,Parking Behavior: Park n Ride (PnR) to encourage multimodalism in Brisbane,Journal Article,"Park n Ride facilities (PnR) initially emerged to accommodate motorists that would otherwise exhaust the local supply of parking around train stations and other rapid high occupancy vehicle nodes but increasing became a planning strategy to provide commuters from auto-dependent suburbs with access to rapid high occupancy vehicle to reduce their environmental impacts and inner-city road and parking capacity requirements. Theoretically, PnR should influence modal choice by making the transfer between car and rapid transit more convenient yet this base assumption rarely matches the empirical reality. Our synthesis of the PnR literature suggests that motorists deciding whether to park-and-ride have considerations beyond minimising their travel duration and expenses, and we develop a new integrative model of PnR, multi-modalism, and modal choice to illustrate how reliability and competing transport planning strategies such as inter-city mobility, transit-oriented development, and active transport interact and inform modal choice. Upon laying these theoretical foundations, we empirically examine the extent to which developing or modifying PnR influences modal choice in our case study context, Brisbane, Australia. Our research findings suggest that it is new rather than modified PnR that influence modal choice and that new park and riders are typically drawn from nearby locations rather than peripheral and therefore auto-dependent areas. This influence is particularly evident in suburbs closer to the inner city, and is problematic given that these are not the intended users of PnR. Our synthesis and examination of multi-modalism and modal choice has important implications for researchers, planners, and policy makers attempting to influence modal choice and improve the efficiency of urban mobility.",2020-01-23T09:02:38Z,Journal Article,"Kimpton, Anthony| Pojani, Dorina| Sipe, Neil| Corcoran, Jonathan|",10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104304,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,Article (original research),"Oxford, United Kingdom",Elsevier,Auto-dependency| Modal choice| Park ‘n’ ride| PnR| Suburbanisation| Transit ridership|,"1107 Forestry| 3305 Geography, Planning and Development| 2309 Nature and Landscape Conservation| 2308 Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law|"
6,UQ:873d063,"Contemporary parking policy, practice, and outcomes in three large Australian cities",Journal Article,"Together, globalisation and urbanisation are accelerating the densification of cities while disruptive technologies such as micro-mobility and ride-hailing are transforming urban mobility. Amidst this change, urban planning officials and practitioners typically remain constrained to the same urban footprint, left to grapple with earlier car-oriented development, and yet must accommodate a growing population and variety of travel modes operating within the same space. Further, they must operate alongside government officials whose re-election could depend upon appeasing suburban residents that are unable or unwilling to relocate along active transport corridors, near public transit nodes, or forgo the flexibility and comfort of private automobiles. As a result, private automobiles can become necessary for traversing urban forms already enlarged by parking, driveways, roads, highways, and flyovers. Likewise, alternatives such as public and active transport can become impractical and dangerous within urban forms that are fragmented by congestion or fast traffic. Given that urban mobility research typically focuses on keeping our pre-existing modal choices moving rather than the side-effects, daily commutes have remained unchanged for decades, and planners are better equipped to continually accommodate rather than influence our modal choices. This volume of Progress in Planning aims to strengthen the evidence base for influencing modal choice by developing a comparative framework of urban mobility, and by examining how parking policy has influenced modal choice within the three largest Australian cities: Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. In addition, it provides reproducible methods for estimating parking supply using land use audits, parking demand using a population census, and geo-statistical modelling for determining whether and where parking policy can explain more sustainable modal choices. As such, this volume sets a research agenda for metropolitan-scale examination and coordination of transport and land use planning for sustainable rather than temporary urban mobility.",2020-06-18T07:53:26Z,Journal Article,"Kimpton, Anthony| Pojani, Dorina| Ryan, Connor| Ouyang, Lisha| Sipe, Neil| Corcoran, Jonathan|",10.1016/j.progress.2020.100506,2020-06-18T00:00:00Z,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,"Critical review of research, literature review, critical commentary","Oxford, United Kingdom",Elsevier,"Geography, Planning and Development|","3305 Geography, Planning and Development|"

During this time, public spaces have undergone a complete transformation, which is examined through a theoretical framework based on under- and over-management critiques of public space. Processes of public space under- and overmanagement are ongoing in Tirana, with neglect, car invasion and space privatization being the most problematic issues.

In search of effective strategies, they often study best practices from elsewhere. Dutch cities are a prime example of bike use in Europe. However, in order to assess the likely success of transferring measures, an accurate comparison of the bicycling context is needed. This study explores the similarities and differences in attitudes and beliefs about the decisions to commute by bicycle to work in three small, cycling-oriented cities: Gouda (The Netherlands), Shkodra (Albania), and Peja (Kosovo). As almost everywhere in the Netherlands, cycling conditions are good in Gouda. Shkodra has one of the highest levels of cycling in the Balkan region and Peja is striving to improve its urban amenities for sustainable transport modes.

After the fall of communism, the ownership and maintenance responsibilities of hundreds of thousands of flats that were constructed and owned by the state was transferred to their occupants. In the capital, Tirana, there was also a huge wave of new condominium construction after 1990. A new law on the management and maintenance of condominium building was recently adopted and is in the early stages of implementation. This article discusses how residents of condominiums actually manage the maintenance of their buildings in Tirana.

The findings reveal that the majority of international students adapt to their new living environment, and even come to prefer a low-density lifestyle and associated positive features (such as higher affordability, privacy, open space, and peacefulness). While this is positive in terms of their personal adjustment and outcomes, it raises concerns in terms of urban sustainability. It may indicate that given the opportunity most people find a suburban, car-oriented lifestyle desirable, and planning systems need to reconcile majority preferences with sustainability concerns. However, the study also reveals that a portion of the international students continue to prefer a high-density urban form. People in this group dislike the long commutes, spread out services, high transport costs, automobile dependence, quietness, and social isolation associated with a suburban lifestyle, and continue to seek urban forms that are similar to their previous environments in Asia.

Through in-depth interviews with twenty participants, we sought to determine whether owner-occupiers of Queenslanders value this heritage and why, whether they are engaged in its protection, and if so, what their motivations are. We found that Queenslanders are valued on multiple levels: as placemaking features, as aesthetic pleasure, and as climatic comfort. While maintaining an older home involves a substantial amount of time and moneyavailable mostly to the middle-class and middle-aged groupsthis is viewed as fair considering the benefits of living in a Queenslander. Residents believe that the local government can and should do more to protect what is left of the historical housing stock. However, one portion of the public only cares to preserve the outer shells of heritage homes while extensively renovating and modernising interiors.

The findings reveal that planning students typically have one of four conceptions of planning research: (1) research as trading of ideas, (2) research as gathering of evidence, (3) research as precursor to design, and (4) research as rhetoric. While the planning schools included in this study have diverse orientations (along the designsocial science continuum), our findings suggest that planning students most often conceptualize this discipline as a social science.

The study reveals that role-playing and serious gaming are equally engaging and help planning students learn and embody different roles while having fun. No great differences can be discerned in terms of learning effectiveness. With regard to teaching style, the GPG is more passive and tends to encourage collaboration, whereas the PPP is more dynamic and fosters competition. Both activities help students discover aspects of planningand planning stakeholderswhich they may not have considered before. Most participating students appear to regard planning as a pluralist pursuit. Communication and public participation are viewed as central to planning processes. However, traces of incrementalism and rationality are also present.

19,UQ:271336,Trends in malaria research in 11 Asian Pacific countries: an analysis of peer-reviewed publications over two decades,Journal Article,"Background: Quantitative data are lacking on published malaria research. The purpose of the study is to characterize trends in malaria-related literature from 1990 to 2009 in 11 Asian-Pacific countries that are committed to malaria elimination as a national goal. Methods. A systematic search was conducted for articles published from January 1990 to December 2009 in PubMed/MEDLINE using terms for malaria and 11 target countries (Bhutan, China, North Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vanuatu). The references were collated and categorized according to subject, Plasmodium species, and whether they contained original or derivative data. Results: 2,700 articles published between 1990 and 2009 related to malaria in the target countries. The annual output of malaria-related papers increased linearly whereas the overall biomedical output from these countries grew exponentially. The percentage of malaria-related publications was nearly 3% (111/3741) of all biomedical publications in 1992 and decreased to less than 1% (118/12171; p < 0.001) in 2009. Thailand had the highest absolute output of malaria-related papers (n = 1211), followed by China (n = 609) and Indonesia (n = 346). Solomon Islands and Vanuatu had lower absolute numbers of publications, but both countries had the highest number of publications per capita (1.3 and 2.5 papers/1,000 population). The largest percentage of papers concerned the epidemiology and control of malaria (53%) followed by studies of drugs and drug resistance (47%). There was an increase in the proportion of articles relating to epidemiology, entomology, biology, molecular biology, pathophysiology and diagnostics from the first to the second decade, whereas the percentage of papers on drugs, clinical aspects of malaria, immunology, and social sciences decreased. Conclusions: The proportion of malaria-related publications out of the overall biomedical output from the 11 target Asian-Pacific countries is decreasing.

20,UQ:381147,"From squatter settlement to suburb: the transformation of Bathore, Albania",Journal Article,"This paper recounts the successful upgrading of Bathore, an informal settlement on government land, located in the outskirts of Tirana, the capital of Albania. Bathore was formed in the early 1990s by poor squatters, mostly from rural northern Albania, a region that became impoverished and lost most services after the fall of communism in 1990. The area that the squatters occupied lacked all infrastructure. However, the squatters built houses that were permanent structures of good quality, often multi-storey.

However, some world cities, such as Paris, have failed to maximize their river potential. The Seine remains underutilized by mass commuter ferries serving the local population. Why, in the modern era, has Paris not taken advantage of its river for commuter transport? Will it do so in the future? This article answers these questions, which are important at the present time of grave sustainability concerns. The identified barriers include: (a) funding constraints; (b) competition by other modes; (c) lack of political and institutional will; (d) lack of opportunity; (e) local legislation; and (f) technical issues.

The Theory of Planned Behaviour is employed as a guiding framework for the analysis. Unlike the car-less, the car-free are physically and intellectually able to drive, and have sufficient income to purchase and maintain a car, yet they have chosen on shun automobility. In a low-density, sprawling, and car-oriented context like Brisbanes, their choice is unusual, hence worth examining. Through in-depth interviews of 24 car-free people, we found that they have embraced car-free living in order to go green; pursue health and well-being; and achieve convenience and minimalism. Personal advantages have priority over collective interests. Participants share a belief that car ownership is simply unnecessary if one makes certain practical adjustments. A characteristic element that unites the car-free is their maverick outlook. All have been willing to defy a key societal norm, automobility, even as this involves some downsides. They believe that the advantages of a car-free life outweigh any drawbacks. It appears that a car-free lifestyle is an educated middle-class phenomenon.

However, as research has focused on users rather than non-users, much less is known about the latter. Understanding the characteristics, behaviours, and motivations of non-users is quite important too, if the planning goal is to shift urban populations from private cars to ridesharing. This study examines both users and non-users in the context of Adelaide, an Australian metropolis of 1.3 million inhabitants. We segment (potential) ridesharers into three groups: (1) users, (2) interested non-users, and (3) non-interested non-users in order to investigate the determinants of their behaviours and preferences in more detail. Applying advanced statistical analyses, we find that population density and housing value at neighbourhood level, higher levels of education and income, causal work status, younger age, and access to smartphones are the key factors associated with higher ridesharing use and/or higher interest in ridesharing. Factors such as concern over safety and security, advanced age, digitalilliteracy, and suburban living lead non-interested non-users to shun ridesharing. Socio-demographic factors such as car ownership, ethnic background; gender, and household size, are not associated with ridesharing behaviours or preferences.

Among those, transport poverty and inequality have significantly affected the daily life of low-income groups. While important, this is an under-researched topic in China. This gap in the academic literature is glaring given the countrys urbanization rates, sprawling cities and income differentials. Most previous studies have only focused on two aspects of transport povertyjob-housing imbalance and accessibility. A comprehensive understanding of the causes and impacts of transport inequality is currently lacking. Therefore, a systematic review of academic literature based on keywords relevant to transport poverty in China was conducted to provide a more complete assessment of the situation in Chinese cities. In total, 62 relevant studies were identified after close examination of the articles (including titles, abstracts, and full-texts). This set of articles allowed a number of general patterns to be identified. It was found that the most common causes of transport poverty include: a lack of access to private vehicles; uneven access to alternative transport options; inadequate public transport provision; jobs-housing imbalance; and thehukousystem (a system of household registration which aims to regulate population distribution and rural-to-urban migration).

28,UQ:732304,"Past, present and future of transit-oriented development in three European capital city regions",Book Chapter,"The concept of Transit-Oriented Developmentdevelopment near, and/or oriented to, mass transit facilitieshas generated much interest in Europe over the last decade. Coined in the United States in the 1990s, the term TOD is frequently assumed to be a recent American import and a reaction to the consequences of mass motorization and sprawl. However, TOD is based on much older ideas of rail-based urban development that took place in many European cities during the 19th and 20th centuries. Arguably, the modern reincarnation of TOD is more focused on urban aesthetics. Other tenets, such as accessibility, density, and mixed-use, have remained more or less unchanged. This article examines how planning policies in three European capital city-regionsAmsterdam, Stockholm, and Viennahave been shaped by the ideas and principles underlying TOD. The three case studies were selected because all are located in European countries with mature systems of spatial planning: the Netherlands (Western Europe), Sweden (Northern Europe), and Austria (Central Europe). The article examines the extent to which planning policies from the mid-20th century to the present have reflected TOD principles. The analysis is based on secondary sources (articles, books, and planning reports), and the focus of the study is on policy rather than measurements and metrics. The last three decades are explored more in depth as material is more readily available. The first part of the analysis summarizes the development of spatial planning in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Austria since WWII, with an eye to highlighting policies that could be considered to be, or might affect, TOD. The second part deals with the implications of these policies in terms of past, present, and future TOD planning and practice in the respective capital city-regions: Amsterdam, Stockholm, and Vienna.",2018-09-24T05:45:42Z,Book Chapter,"Pojani, Dorina| Stead, Dominic |",10.1016/bs.atpp.2018.07.003,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,,Research book chapter (original research),"London, United Kingdom",Academic Press (Elsevier),Austria| City-regions| Netherlands| Planning| Sweden| Transit-Oriented Development|,3313 Transportation|

The analysis reveals eight themes. The press has: (1) questioned the states legitimacy to govern, (2) characterized squatters as citizens; (3) sympathized with squatters; (4) de-legitimized controls on informal housing and the classes in power; (5) expressed resentment towards powerful elites which have also engaged in informal construction; (6) engaged in nostalgic reminiscing about the rule of law under socialism; (7) engaged in exclusionary discourse towards squatters; and (8) criminalized squatters. Given the regions socialist legacy of egalitarianism, negative representations of squatters have been mostly symbolic and they have not significantly diminished their chances of bettering their lives in the city.

The evidence presented in the paper suggests that while the Chinese public agrees with many of the basic TOD tenets laid out in the international literature, views about specific design aspects are closely linked to national cultural views and practices. Chinese urbanites are as desirous for human activities, pedestrian safety and comfort, visual variety, natural elements (trees and water) and complexity in outdoor spaces as Western publics. At the same time, in line with Chinas pre-socialist and socialist style of urbanism, support for cycling and bus lanes, as well as mixed uses and commerce (including street vending) in TOD streets, is much higher than in Western countries.

34,UQ:734032,Gauging differences in public transport symbolism across national cultures: implications for policy development and transfer,Journal Article,"The use of different forms of public transport connotes different symbolic meanings across national cultures. This has relevance when encouraging the uptake of public transport in Asia's megacities such as Beijing or Chennai, where rapid deterioration in air quality has been partly attributed to a rapid increase in private motorised transport ownership and usage. Yet the social connotations of using public transport might not always be positive. Whilst metro systems may be seen as progressive and uniting, bus-based transit is still often seen as a poor cousin. This may present a significant impediment when encouraging a shift from private to public transport in cities where the national culture mandates visible differentiation between those of differing social status. This study uses deductive thematic analysis based upon symbolic permutations, to explore these concepts across two meta cultural clusters, each consisting of two sub clusters segmented by means of the Hofstede national culture indices: low power differential/individualistic (Anglo, Nordic), and high power differential/collectivist (Confucian, and South Asian). Using horizontal purposive sampling, sufficient differences are observed, as to the symbolism of the public transport modes across the groups, to justify an expansion of theory to the population of interest.

The case study is Tepito, a barrio in Mexico City. The results, based on 20 qualitative interviews with local residents, support the idea that an urban acupuncture approach has a high potential in this respect. In view of these findings, the authors argue that an indirect approach, focused on physical space, might, at least in the short term, be more productive in empowering of informal settlement dwellers than direct efforts at political organization.

Set in a contested inner city area of Brisbane, Australia, the research associates neoliberal planning objectives with the discretionary decision-making specifically embedded in performance-based planning. The neoliberalisation of planning is, we submit, symptomatic of a post-ideological politics of consensus that actually erodes properly political moments and renders the political merely administrative. We explore these matters by reference to a particular case study involving a spatial planning project that resulted in height and density being extended to unprecedented levels, and competitive economic value and city branding being prioritised over the local value of the place. This discretionary action, limited formal participation opportunities, and existing low levels of community trust motivated local residents to mobilise against the plan and design alternatives. To understand the role of trust and participation in performance-based planning, both in this case and more generally, a number of stakeholders were interviewed and surveyed to gather their views on participation, trust, and discretion in planning, and on the performance-based planning system. A surprising research finding is that many stakeholders expressed trust in planning professionals but distrust in the planning system in which planners operate, and they did so on the understanding that the system gives unfettered priority to economic growth objectives.",2018-10-24T13:20:45Z,Journal Article,"Kwok, Melanie| Johnson, Laurel| Pojani, Dorina|",10.1111/1745-5871.12310,2018-10-14T00:00:00Z,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,Article (original research),"Richmond, VIC, Australia",Wiley-Blackwell,"Earth-Surface Processes| Geography, Planning and Development|","3305 Geography, Planning and Development| 1904 Earth-Surface Processes|"

This study, set in Liverpool, England, analyses and compares three variations of the privatization of public space production: entirely private development; public private partnership (PPP); and community-led development. The purpose is to determine whether, why, and by how much publicness has declined in the production of urban spaces. While most planning literature has tended to demonize privatization, this study reveals that processes which tend to be collaborative and involve multiple public and private stakeholders have a higher degree of publicness compared to both entirely privately-led and entirely publicly-led processes.",2020-03-04T00:42:18Z,Journal Article,"Leclercq, Els| Pojani, Dorina| Van Bueren, Ellen|",10.1016/j.cities.2020.102649,2020-05-01T00:00:00Z,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,Article (original research),"Oxford, United Kingdom",Elsevier,"Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management| Development| Sociology and Political Science| Urban Studies|","3303 Development| 3312 Sociology and Political Science| 3322 Urban Studies| 1409 Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management|"

In this analysis, the purpose of this paper is to set forth a conceptual framework, which considers the context in which informality takes place, the settlement itself, the houses contained therein, the dwellers of those houses and the process through which a settlement is designed and transformed over time. Design/methodology/approach: This is a literature review. Findings: This framework aims to be sufficiently flexible to be deployed across diverse national settings. Its formulation is important because informal settlements are a permanent fixture of the global urban landscape, and are increasing in scale. Originality/value: Any sustainable strategies to improve informal settlements depend on a better understanding of their urban space, as well as of the producers of this space the residents themselves.

This study presents data on the urban travel and mobility patterns of older adults in Shiraz, Iran a country where the population is ageing faster than the average of western societies. The relationship between car use and socio-demographic and built environment variables is investigated through Ordinary Least Squares and Geographically Weighted Regression models. These models show that the main determinants of car use among older adults are: employment status; household size; car ownership rate; trip purpose; property prices; and mixed land-uses. Also, the study reveals that car dependency is significant and more pronounced among wealthier individuals, who tend to be clustered in the northern section of the city. The population density and road network design characteristics do not affect car use among older adults, while a mix of land-uses tends to attenuate car dependency. Gender gaps in car use are much wider than in the West, and some level of spatial mismatch between travel needs and car access is observed in the southern section of the city.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for polymyxin B and colistin in the companion animals was significantly higher than in human isolates (P=0.033and P=0.013,respectively). Genotyping revealed that the veterinary isolates were spread throughout the population, with shared array types from human infections such as keratitis and respiratory infections, suggesting the potential for zoonotic transmission. Whole genome sequencing revealed mutations in genes associated with polymyxin resistance and other antimicrobial resistance-related genes.<br /><br />The high levels of resistance to polymyxin shown here, along with genetic similarities between some human and animal isolates, together suggest a need for sustained surveillance of this veterinary niche as a potential reservoir for resistant, clinically relevant bacteria in both animals and humans.",2019-07-09T10:46:37Z,Journal Article,"Scott, Andrea| Pottenger, Sian| Timofte, Dorina| Moore, Matthew| Wright, Laura| Kukavica-Ibrulj, Irena| Jeukens, Julie| Levesque, Roger C| Freschi, Luca| Pinchbeck, Gina L| Schmidt, Vanessa M| McEwan, Neil| Radford, Alan D| Fothergill, Joanne L|",10.1136/vr.105075,2019-06-25T00:00:00Z,,Article (original research),"London, United Kingdom",BMJ,antimicrobials| bacterial pathogenesis| bacteriology| infection|,
49,UQ:390850,Obstacles to the creation of successful bus rapid transit systems: the case of Bangkok,Journal Article,"Bangkok has failed in the implementation of its BRT system. The single line in operation since 2010 stretches only 15 km and transports merely 15,000 passengers daily. This article examines the reasons why Bangkok has (so far) been unable to implement a full BRT system, unlike many counterparts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which have similar financial constraints. The authors' position is that there is as much to learn from failure as from success. BRT issues are placed in the broader context of urban transport problems in Bangkok. The study indicates that the Bangkok BRT project was curtailed due to a combination of reasons, which confirm the findings of prior studies on BRT planning and implementation worldwide. The crucial issues in this case were the weak and discontinued political leadership and the failure to manage competing modes, the primary of which is the automobile. Nonetheless, creating a however limited BRT system was not a loss for Bangkok and extension plans could always be resumed in the future. Should another attempt be made at creating an integrated and large-scale BRT system, local planners and leaders who care about the city's sustainable future must avoid repeating past mistakes and falling into past behavioral patterns.

Although Tirana is a very compact city with work, services, and social contacts typically within walking distance, the findings indicate that most adolescents in Tirana, including those who do not particularly like cars and driving, intend to purchase cars and drive in the future. Cars remain a strong status symbol. This does do not bode well for transport sustainability.

A survey of students aged 11 to 13, revealed that an overwhelming majority walk to school, while bicycling and bus use are minimal. Students who walk to school often do so as part of a larger group of schoolmates, attend schools that are located relatively near their house, are faced with relatively few major road crossings during their journey, and belong to families that are less likely to own a car. Children who are driven to school (only 13.5% of our sample) usually have higher-income families and live farther from the school. Although Tirana's high residential density has some environmental drawbacks, we deem it positive in that its result is that most students live very close to their schools and in close proximity to classmates walking to school. The fine grain pattern of the urban public school network contributes to the short distances between schools and homes.

In recent years their popularity has soared. This study examined Brisbanes CityCycle scheme, the largest PBSP in Australia, and investigated the role of (natural and built) environmental features on usage. The study addressed four research questions: (1) What are dynamics of PBSP use in terms of travel time, speed, and distance? (2) What is the relationship between PBSP participation and cycling infrastructure? (3) How does land-use affect PBSP usage? (4) How does topography affect PBSP usage? To answer these four questions, the authors analysed large existing datasets on CityCycle usage, land-use, topography, and cycling infrastructure, which were each obtained through multiple sources. Correlation and regression analysis were employed to establish significant relationships amongst variables. It was found that: most users take short trips within the free initial period provided under the CityCycle scheme and do not incur any charges other than for membership; PBSP use is strongly correlated with the length of off-road bikeways near each CityCycle station; CityCycle is more frequently used on weekends and for recreational purposes; loop journeys, which are also associated with leisure trips, are popular in Brisbane, especially on weekends; leisure trips are taken at a relatively slower pace than utilitarian trips; during weekdays, a trimodal peak is clearly evident, with PBSP commute trips in the morning and evening peaks and a smaller but significant peak around lunchtime; and users avoid returning CityCycle bicycles to stations located on hilltops.

We have collected and analyzed primary survey data on the school travel patterns of 472 school-age children in Hanoi, Vietnam. The findings show that the Covid-19 pandemic has been quite detrimental: once schools reopened, the prevalence of active school travel decreased from 53% to less than 31%. Where parents, especially mothers, did not face barriers to motorized travel, they assumed the role of chauffeur. Parents who were more concerned about community infections were more motivated to shift children to motorized modes.

63,UQ:68fffad,Why are cities removing their freeways? A systematic review of the literature,Journal Article,"A scientific consensus has recently emerged suggesting that the dominant twentieth century paradigm of solving transportation congestion problems by building more freeways failed. The legacy of the freeway construction era is clearly visible in polluted and congested cities worldwide. To battle these ills, planning academics have been promoting more sustainable built form aligned with dedicated public/active transport provision. Partly as a result of the push coming from academia, a number of cities have sought to remove their freeways and replace the freed up space with alternate transport infrastructure, such as streets and boulevards. To discern if the transportation planning profession is currently undergoing a paradigm shift or whether freeway removal is merely a temporary fad, we have conducted a systematic review of the literature. In this article, we unpack the underlying reasons which have led some cities to removing their freeways. Results reveal that a paradigm shift has arguably not yet taken place in transportation planning. While many cities are creating human-scale and active transport spaces, currently these spaces tend to coexist alongside freeways. American cities, which were once the pioneers of freeway construction, appear to be lagging behind cities in Europe and Asia in this respect. If the current pace of freeway removal continues, it may take a few decades before the transportation planners, politicians, policy makers, and communities adopt radically different norms, methods, and goals. However, a radical approach may need to be taken sooner given alarming global warming predictions.",2020-03-24T00:30:23Z,Journal Article,"Khalaj, Fahimeh| Pojani, Dorina| Sipe, Neil| Corcoran, Jonathan|",10.1080/01441647.2020.1743919,2020-03-23T00:00:00Z,2020-03-24T00:00:00Z,Article (original research),"Abingdon, Oxon, United Kingdom",Routledge,Highway removal| Freeway removal| Paradigm shift| Transportation planning| Boulevards|,3313 Transportation|
64,UQ:71fcf67,Public space privatisation: are users concerned?,Journal Article,"Academics have decried the erosion of public space under the neoliberal practices that have taken root since the 1980s in cities around the world. However, it is unclear whether users are concerned about the ownership of the urban spaces they use. To find out, this study surveyed users and observed their behaviour in three types of public spaces in Liverpool, UK: one entirely private development, one public-private partnership, and one urban renewal project taken over by a grassroots organization. The findings indicate that users appreciate privatised areas for the pleasant, clean, and safe environment they offer, as well as for the socialising opportunities. At the same time, privatised spaces send subtle signals to users that certain activities, people, or behaviours are not tolerated or encouraged. To reinforce the democratic essence of public space, values of appropriation should be safeguarded in all types of urban spaces, including privately produced ones.",2021-06-15T05:59:09Z,Journal Article,"Leclercq, Els| Pojani, Dorina|",10.1080/17549175.2021.1933572,2021-06-14T00:00:00Z,2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,Article (original research),"Abingdon, Oxon, United Kingdom",Routledge,"Geography, Planning and Development| Urban Studies|","3305 Geography, Planning and Development| 3322 Urban Studies|"

66,UQ:365209,Sustainable urban transport in the developing world: beyond megacities,Journal Article,"Megacities have frequently received a disproportionate amount of attention over other sizes of cities in recent discourse on urban sustainability. In this article, the authors argue that a focus on smaller and medium-sized cities is crucial to achieving substantial progress towards more sustainable urban development, not only because they are home to at least a quarter of the worlds population but because they also offer great potential for sustainable transformations. In principle, their size allows for flexibility in terms of urban expansion, adoption of green travel modes, and environmental protection. At the same time, smaller and medium-sized cities often have fewer resources to implement new transport measures and can be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the world economy. This article critically reviews the potential role and impact of nine commonly considered options for sustainable urban transport in cities in developing countries: (1) road infrastructure; (2) rail-based public transport; (3) road-based public transport; (4) support for non-motorized travel modes; (5) technological solutions; (6) awareness-raising campaigns; (7) pricing mechanisms; (8) vehicle access restrictions; and (9) control of land-uses. Drawing on international research and examples of policies to reduce the environmental impacts of transport in urban areas, this article identifies some key lessons for sustainable urban transport in smaller and medium-sized cities in developing countries.

The results do not provide evidence to support the role of income inequality as a mediator of the link between sprawl and well-being. Instead, the results tell a more nuanced story. Specifically, they indicate that consistent with a priori expectations, lower levels of sprawl are, on average, associated with lower levels of income inequality. Additionally, lower levels of sprawl correspond to higher levels of financial well-being. Supplementary investigation into this finding reveals that this disguises a very different experience among Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with higher levels of financial wellbeing, in which lower sprawl corresponds more strongly to higher levels of financial well-being.

Here, it is a rather spatially constricted job search range rather than transport poverty that prevents women living in first-ring suburbs from attaining satisfactory employment. Female commutes are extraordinarily short and most often on foot. While the city now has nearly one million inhabitants and a high car ownership rate, and is located in Europe, the employment and mobility choices and behaviors of its female residents resemble those in developing rather than developed countries, and in small rather than large cities. The reasons underpinning this situation have more to do with socio-cultural gender barriers and less with transport poverty or labor market weaknesses.

Understanding these latent drivers of behaviour will allow countries to develop and import policies to more successfully promote sustainable transport. Transport symbolism what people believe their ownership or use of a mode connotes to others about their societal position has been shown to be one such, non-trivial, hidden motivator. In the case of hybrid and electric cars (eco cars), studies have demonstrated how their symbolic value varies within a society among different social groups. As yet, however, there has been scant research into comparing how the symbolism of a mode varies across national cultures, horizontally, between individuals with similar socio-demographic characteristics. Through qualitative thematic analysis, this study utilises two of Hofstede's cross-cultural indices power differential and individualism versus collectivism to develop and strengthen theory on how the differing symbolism of eco cars currently varies between four cultural clusters Anglo, Nordic, Confucian and South Asian. It also deliberates how observed symbolic qualitative differences may influence an individual or group choice to procure eco cars. Finally, it discusses how policy development, transfer and marketing, within the context of eco cars, may need to be modified by national governments, in the Confucian and South Asian cultures, so as to encourage uptake and modal shift.",2018-07-02T00:28:31Z,Journal Article,"Ashmore, David | Pojani, Dorina | Thoreau, Roselle | Christie, Nicola | Tyler, Nicholas |",10.1016/j.trd.2018.06.024,2018-08-01T00:00:00Z,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,Article (original research),"Kidlington, Oxford United Kingdom",Pergamon Press,General Environmental Science| Transportation|,2205 Civil and Structural Engineering| 3313 Transportation| 2300 Environmental Science|

80,UQ:cdf2293,Public space privatisation: The experience of Indonesian cities,Thesis,"Context: The privatisation of public space has been triggered by a thematic and aesthetic approach planning, increasing control over urban inhabitants activities, commercialisation for economic interests, and the presence of virtual space. Globalisation and neoliberalism play a vital role in encouraging the privatisation and homogenisation of the public space concept. This privatisation has eroded the publicness values of public space, which is aligned with previous studies in developed countries (Western Europe and the USA). Studies examining this phenomenon in developing countries, especially in Indonesia, are limited and tend to use Western perspectives as a basis for analytical approaches. Meanwhile, every society has specific local values that cannot be generalised, which has the potential to create a different perspective.Objective: This study aims to understand the privatisation of public space and its implications for people in the context of Indonesia cities. In addition to fill research gaps for the developing countries, this study is also beneficial as a reference for all stakeholders in producing a contextual public space.Method: The study uses a qualitative method with a phenomenological approach. Data is collected through in-depth interviews with respondents from various backgrounds who experience and interact directly with public spaces. Interviews with parties representing developers, planners, users, experts, observers, and researchers related to public space provide balanced and accurate information. Reviews of historical documents, journalistic reports, scientific studies, and government documents are carried out to complete the primary data. The cities of Surabaya and Bandung were chosen as study locations because they are currently considered successful in public space planning. As metropolitan cities that interact directly with global trends, both display similar images to other world cities. It is interesting to examine whether privatisation also takes place there, what the impact is to the community, and how the community reacts to it.Results: Indonesian cities also experience the privatisation of public space as other cities in developed countries, however, the Indonesian society responded relatively different from existing theories. Local values have played a substantial role in shaping people perspective. People who hold religious and local ethical values produce permissive responses to control in the public space. People who are familiar with the flexibility of communal space to accommodate various activities, including economic activities, make commercial activities in public places as an attraction. Political transformation plays a vital role in introducing formal public space as a social space. The issue of privatisation has not been able to dampen public attention to attractive formal urban open places. However, criticism of the non-contextual concept of public space began to sound. The dominance of the authorities and investors in the production process has commodified public space for the elite benefit.Conclusion: Each society has local wisdom that is unique from the others and is very instrumental in shaping the way people think. Therefore, planning for public space needs a more contextual concept, not just following global trends. Political reform must be realised through a more participatory planning process to accommodate the aspirations of urban inhabitants.",2021-06-02T03:20:48Z,Thesis,"Panjaitan, Tigor Wilfritz Soaduon|",10.14264/cdf2293,2021-06-21T00:00:00Z,,PhD Thesis,,,privatisation| public sphere| public space| planning| phenomenology| Indonesia| social value| Surabaya| Bandung|,1205 Urban and Regional Planning|
81,UQ:697925,A living room in the city: the place of public space in the everyday lives of Middle Eastern women in Greater Brisbane,Thesis,"With the first step people take out of their homes, they enter public territory. One of the significant visions for urban planners producing spaces for public life is creating a feeling of comfort for each urban dweller in this wide territory of many. Successful public spaces can only be produced through informed planning and understanding the needs of all urban dwellers. In an attempt to understand the needs of one group of urban dwellers, Middle Eastern women in Greater Brisbane, this study investigates their everyday experiences of public spaces in Greater Brisbane and explores the suitability of available public spaces for this group.The aim of this study is to answer questions about the roles that urban spaces play in the daily lives of migrant women to find ways of making better connections between their everyday experience as migrants and public spaces as a constituent element of social life. To introduce a platform in which the voice of this minority group could be heard this study is an attempt to explore and understand the role and structure of urban spaces from three different angles: the meaning of public and private space, and relationships between the two spaces; diversity and migration and the impact of these on the everyday life of migrant people (especially on their use of public space); and women and their needs and expectations for urban spaces. These three different themes, in addition to the characteristics of Australian society and cities, could describe the main question of this research: how can the experiences of Middle Eastern migrant women using public spaces inform the planning and design of such spaces?Phenomenology is the research approach adopted in this study. A Phenomenological approach is appropriate when the research question requires an intimate awareness and deep understanding of how humans experience a situation. Based on data collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews with twenty Middle Eastern women, and with the assist of NVivo software and Phenomenological approach (Moustakas&rsquo; modification of the Van Kaam model), twelve themes were identified that address the way this group of urban dwellers experience the built and natural environment.Aside from an in-depth understanding of the urban experience for Middle Eastern women, the findings from this study recognises and understands how minority groups/migrants experience urban settings presenting possible ways planning disciplines could better respond to the needs and expectations of these urban dwellers. The research findings presented in this study contribute to planning involving Middle Eastern populations in multicultural settings and show how gender, social construct, ethnic composition, religious beliefs, and lifestyle define and change the ways in which urban spaces are experienced and used by these urban dwellers. Subsequently these findings emphasize the role of urban specialists, particularly urban planners, in design and production of inclusive urban spaces that are suitable for use by multicultural groups and provide the possibility of intercultural dialogue. For example, inclusive spatial production of urban spaces considers Muslim women and their cultural-religious beliefs in the production of more woman-friendly spaces. This study suggests that the more people encounter and are exposed to other cultures and ethnicities, the more the democratic aspect of &lsquo;public&rsquo; is demonstrated.The findings in this study also suggest that by recognising the needs of ethnic groups/minorities in the social construct of multicultural cities, public spaces could have more harmony and features that help promote Brisbane and the Greater Brisbane region as world-class. These features include neighbourhoods with mixed-use design, neighbourhoods as arenas of social life, women-only public services and facilities, planning with the aid of cultural maps, and advocating night-life activities and cultural/ethnic/religious festivals. Planning for such spaces on a neighbourhood and city scale produces places that help women create meaning out of their everyday urban lives and helps them adapt to their new cultural and social setting in Australian cities.Shopping centres, local and regional parks, and well-maintained sidewalks are some examples of these meaningful places. Diverse night-life, well-lit routes, local public recreational facilities, and walkable shopping streets are some examples of cultural and environmental requisites that help Middle Eastern women enjoy a lifestyle better suited to their expectations and understanding of public spaces. These well-planned public spaces could help women to leave the safe haven of their homes and other private spaces in order to blend in or connect with the new society of their host country. This process of assimilation can gradually change their &lsquo;host country&rsquo; into their new &lsquo;home country&rsquo; by making memories, history, and attachment associated with everyday places of their life. Spatial production of inclusive urban spaces could be the key factor in providing all groups of urban dwellers with different ethnicities, backgrounds, values and beliefs, with equal opportunity to assert their right to the city.",2017-11-26T23:45:25Z,Thesis,"Gholamhosseini, Roja|",10.14264/uql.2018.16,2017-11-29T00:00:00Z,,,,,Social sciences| Public spaces| Urban design and planning| Phenomenology| Production of space| Middle East| Migrant women| Nightlife| Cultural diversity| Multicultural cities|,1205 Urban and Regional Planning| 1604 Human Geography| 2002 Cultural Studies|
82,UQ:a71113d,Climate sensitive urban design:a comparison between Brisbane (Australia) and Nagpur (India),Thesis,"Understanding of microclimate is important for built environment professionals to create urban environments that could encourage users to venture out and enjoy the outdoors. &ldquo;Urban &lsquo;climate-sensitive&rsquo; design is defined as a process that considers the fundamental elements of microclimates (e.g., sun, wind, temperature) for design purposes&rdquo; (Tapias and Schmitt, 2014). Climate sensitive urban design is very crucial especially in a modern context where built environment professionals face the challenge of decreasing the negative effects of climate change on our built and natural environment through design and planning decisions. The study is carried out as a comparison between Brisbane and Nagpur with an awareness that urban planning evolves as a response to social, cultural and climate conditions and deeply embedded in socio-cultural fabric but at the same time, comparative research can impart invaluable insights into local practices, policy-making and implementation from other places and valuable lessons can be learned. The study has been carried out for pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras in Brisbane (Australia) and Nagpur (India).&nbsp; Urban design is studied for each era and lessons are extracted to narrow down a list of climate sensitive urban design elements. It is also crucial to review whether current planning regulations are adequate to equip built environment professionals with policies to design a climate sensitive urban environment. This is the intent behind the document analysis of policy documents developed by the local development authorities from Brisbane and Nagpur. Through the focus group discussions and personal interviews of built environment professionals in Brisbane and Nagpur, the research presents the possible barriers faced by these professionals in implementing climate sensitive urban design innovations in their current projects. The research highlights that path-dependence is a deep driver of barriers and limits to adaptation. The research also presents climate sensitive design innovations from Brisbane and Nagpur where the built environment professionals have taken a step beyond the barriers to work out innovative solutions.The term &ldquo;Aboriginal people&rdquo; is used respectfully in this document for Aboriginal people of Australia as specified by Department (2013).The term &ldquo;built environment professionals&rdquo; is used to include urban designers, urban planners, architects, landscape architects and environmental managers.",2020-04-15T04:22:32Z,Thesis,"Bhoge, Renuka|",10.14264/uql.2020.710,2020-04-29T00:00:00Z,,,,,Barriers| Climate sensitive urban design| Path dependence| Brisbane| Nagpur|,1604 Human Geography| 0915 Interdisciplinary Engineering|
